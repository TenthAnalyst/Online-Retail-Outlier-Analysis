# Online Retail Analysis

This project was assigned by NOD Coding Data Analytics bootcamp in Stockholm, Sweden on May 16th. The purpose of this project was to practice data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Presentation

The presentation file for this project is `presentation.excalidraw`, which can be accessed at [ExcaliDraw](https://www.excalidraw.com). The presentation analyzes a fictional UK company called ACME Co., where I, as the analyst, am responsible for analyzing purchase orders that occurred outside the UK.

The focus of the presentation is on outliers, specifically:

- The customer who made the most purchases
- The products that were most frequently purchased by the top customer
- The countries where those top products are most successful

## Notebook and Dataset

The analysis supporting the presentation was conducted in the Jupyter Notebook `online_retail.ipynb`. The dataset used for the analysis can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail) and is named `online_retail.csv`.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook online_retail.ipynb`
4. Run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Conclusion

Through the analysis of the online retail dataset, valuable insights were gained regarding customer purchasing patterns, top-selling products, and successful countries for sales. This information can be used to optimize marketing strategies, identify key customer segments, and make data-driven business decisions.
